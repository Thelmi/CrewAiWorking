# **VMS (Virtual Market Simulator)**  
*Simulating market dynamics for better decision-making.*

---

## **Problem**  
Understanding and predicting market response, sales, growth, and vision when introducing a business, product, or policy is complex and uncertain.  
Companies, governments, and entrepreneurs often face challenges in making informed decisions about entering a market, expanding to new regions, or launching new initiatives.  
These challenges arise due to the lack of tools to simulate market dynamics, assess public response, and visualize potential outcomes.

---

## **Solution**  
The Market Simulator addresses this challenge by providing an interactive tool to simulate market scenarios. It takes two key inputs:  
- A description of the business/product/policy/etc.  
- A description of the market (e.g., a global market, specific country, or city).  

Using this information, the system simulates the market's response, including potential sales, public sentiment, growth trajectory, and alignment with the market's vision.  
By leveraging historical data, market analysis algorithms, and sentiment intelligence, the simulator offers actionable insights, helping users anticipate market outcomes and make data-driven decisions.  

This tool benefits businesses, policymakers, and investors by reducing risk, enhancing strategic planning, and improving the success rate of new market entries or initiatives.

## **Technical Choices**  
The VMS integrates the following technologies:  
- **SambaNova Models:** Real-time inference for running high-speed simulations with large datasets.  
- **CrewAI:** Multi-agent system creation for market scenario simulations.  
- **Serper Tools:** Seamless data retrieval for market-specific analysis.
